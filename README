### Get Delayed Jobs working
** Create the necessare files with: script/generate delayed_job
** To start collecting persons or feeds you need to start a couple of delayed job workers:
*** To do so use the script "./script/delayed_job -n 4"
*** The Benchmarks I measured are depending on the number of workers (n):
**** Collecting Tweets: n 4: 40.000 tweets in 10min
**** n 8: 90.000 tweets in 10min
**** n 16: 180.000 tweets in 10 min (70% CPU usage)
